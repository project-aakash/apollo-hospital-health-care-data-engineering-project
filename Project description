Apollo Health Care Data Pipeline using Azure Data Factory

Introduction The Apollo Health Care project aims to build a centralized data repository that serves as a single source of truth for Data Analytics and Data Science teams. This centralized table adheres to the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers), ensuring scalability, data integrity, and optimized performance.

Business Requirement Document (BRD)

Project Objective The objective of this project is to build a centralized data repository that serves as a single source of truth for Data Analytics and Data Science teams.

Key Considerations

Medallion Architecture Implementation

Bronze Layer: Raw, unprocessed data ingestion.

Silver Layer: Standardized, cleaned, and enriched data with schema validation.

Gold Layer: Aggregated, business-ready data optimized for analytics and AI models.

Implementation Steps

Step 1: Data Ingestion

Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion from multiple sources such as CSV files, databases, and APIs into the Bronze layer.

Step 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation

Silver Layer: Standardizing, cleaning, and enriching the raw data. Applying schema validation to ensure data integrity.

Step 3: Data Aggregation and Optimization

Gold Layer: Aggregating the cleaned data to create business-ready datasets optimized for analytics and AI models.

Step 4: Data Storage and Access

Storing the data in Azure Data Lake and providing access to the Data Analytics and Data Science teams.

Results and Analysis

Scalability: The centralized data repository can scale easily to accommodate growing data volumes.

Data Integrity: Schema validation ensures the accuracy and consistency of the data.

Performance: Optimized data layers improve query performance for analytics and AI models.

Conclusion The Apollo Health Care Data Pipeline using Azure Data Factory successfully builds a centralized data repository that adheres to the Medallion Architecture. This implementation ensures scalability, data integrity, and optimized performance, making it a valuable resource for Data Analytics and Data Science teams.
